  Simple Arduino-Uno program for a three button circuit with three separate audio speaker signals.
  Author : Kanishka Rupasinghe, Copyright Â© 2021

  This is the code needed for the 3 button speaker circuit, which has to be uploaded to the arduino
  board for the speaker and buttons to function together with the circuit.

  Summary : The circuit has three buttons and a speaker (among other components including arduino board).
  When any one of the buttons is pressed, the sound signal of beeps and silences is sounded out by the speaker.
  Once a button is pressed, no other button's singal will be sounded, until the first signal of beeping has
  stopped. Any sequence and length of beeps and silences can be attached to any one of the buttons, as the
  as this sounding instruction is held in the code below, and is uploaded to the arduino board using the upload
  function of the Arduino IDE software.
